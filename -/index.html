        Nashville-based Musician & Producer ~

        Developer.

      <p>
        As a web developer, who specializes in front-end & back-end, I believe in designing a cleaner, more accessible
        world,
        where user-interfaces are mediums between human & machine that foster intelligent, intuitive, and delightful
        interactions. Together, through a collective effort, we can bridge the intersection of simplicity & function to
        craft
        an inspiring, compelling and authentic brand narrative. Let's design a world that's thoughtful, considered and
        aesthetically pleasing.</p>

        As a producer, musician, and overall music-lover, I'm here to help push your music into an
        eclectic, yet palatable sonic space.
        <br>
        I've been helping artists put their best foot forward in some way or
        another for the better part of a decade.
        <br>
        I want to work with you to find out how your music should look,
        sound, and feel.
        <br>
        I believe a good song has a persona.
        <br>
        And a great song... Well, that carries an entire
        story and identity.
        <br>
        Authenticity isn't just some fuzzword. It's quintessential for continuance and there's
        nothing more important than feeling like the realest version of yourself as an artist.
        <br>
        Your music & artistry
        is how your audience identifies you, both in the world and their own personal lives.
        <br>
        Let's be sure they
        experience the authentic you.
